# chronus

The missing stopwatch for Erlang.

## Getting Started

`chronus` is a simple application that leverages on Erlang's metaprogramming
capabilities to provide Erlang developers with a tool to measure how long does
it take for a particular function to finish its work.

## TL;DR

```erlang
application:start(chronus).

Opts = [{file, "/tmp/chronus.output"}].

Pid  = chronus:start(Opts).

MFAs = [{proplists, get_value, 2}].
ok   = chronus:time(MFAs, Pid).

ok   = chronus:stop(Pid).
```
